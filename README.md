# Pear
Pear is a front–end kit intended to be a starting point for any website or web app project. It takes advantage of the latest web development best practices and is purposefully lean so that it can be easily used on any project without worrying about pre–built styling.

Pear is not a UI framework. Frameworks are great and are extremely useful in some situations, like when you’re building prototypes. But with a framework like Foundation or Bootstrap, someone else has already coded a LOT of CSS for you – you have to go through their docs to understand everything and know what things to put where to get your desired effect and then delete everything you don’t use. In other words, you are adhering your work to what someone else built. Pear, on the other hand, simply lays a solid foundation for you to begin creating your own HTML and CSS. 

Pear represents a lot of research and inspiration from several excellent sources, and is a continual work in progress. Feel free to use anything you like.

Branches and pull requests are welcomed!

## Goals
1. Bring together best practices from many credible sources across the web.
2. Utilize powerful front–end tools (like Grunt).
3. Make it faster and easier to produce great work!

## What's Inside?
- HTML5 boilerplate, with the beginnings of a pattern library inside
- Sass boilerplate, organized using OOCSS and design system principles
	- Normalization and best practices pulled from multiple sources for a number of elements
	- A custom grid utilizing inline-block instead of floats
	- A few useful mixins
	- A print styling boilerplate
- Grunt.js setup and boilerplate
- Humans and robots boilerplates
- [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) installation

## How to Use
We encourage you to download or fork Pear, look through what the default version has, and then add or subtract code according to your preferences. In other words, build your own Pear!

Where some base styling is provided, it is pretty basic and is meant to show the developer some good options and help provide a pattern for coding. Add and subtract whatever you want.
